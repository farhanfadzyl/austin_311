FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`
WHERE duration >= 1200


## Practice 3: What are the names of the stations that bike_id 1710 started from?
## use DISTICNT to reflect just the unique values

WHERE bike_id = 1710


## Practice 4: How many bike_ids have ended at "Moor Street, Soho"
## use DISTINCT to reflect just the unique values

SELECT

WHERE end_station_name = "Moor Street, Soho"


## Practice 5: What is the station_id for "Canton Street, Poplar"?
