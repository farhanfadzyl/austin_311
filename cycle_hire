## use DISTICNT to reflect just the unique values

WHERE bike_id = 1710


## Practice 4: How many bike_ids have ended at "Moor Street, Soho"
## use DISTINCT to reflect just the unique values

SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT bike_id) AS num_of_bike_ended_at_Moor_Street_Soho

WHERE end_station_name = "Moor Street, Soho"


## Practice 5: What is the station_id for "Canton Street, Poplar"?
