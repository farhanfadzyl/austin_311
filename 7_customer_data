## Practice 1: using SELECT and FROM

SELECT 
    name,
    city
FROM `data-analytics-course-339104.8_customer_data.1_customer_address`



## Practice 2: Insert new data into a database

# Start with where we're trying to insert this data, the customer underscore address table.
INSERT INTO `data-analytics-course-339104.8_customer_data.1_customer_address`
    # Specify which columns we're adding this data to by typing their names in the parentheses.
    (customer_id, address, city, state, zipcode, country)
    
# Then we'll tell it what values we're putting in.
VALUES
    (2645, '333 SQL Road', 'Jackson', 'MI', 49202, 'US')



## Practice 3: Update database

# Specify the name of the dataset
UPDATE `data-analytics-course-339104.8_customer_data.1_customer_address`

# let it know what value we're trying to change.
SET address = '123 New Address'

# also need to tell it where we're making that change specifically so that it doesn't change every address in the table
WHERE customer_id = 2645
